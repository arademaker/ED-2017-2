# In our median-finding algorithm (Section 2.4), a basic primitive is
# the split operation, which takes as input an array S and a value v
# and then divides S into three sets: the elements less than v, the
# elements equal to v, and the elements greater than v. Show how to
# implement this split operation in place, that is, without allocating
# new memory.
