;; this code assumes a trie of entities built by
;; trie.lisp. (recognize-ents-in-sentences ) will take this trie and a
;; list of sentences (list of list of characters) and recognize the
;; entities found in each sentence, outputting the results in the
;; following format (called 'entrec' in the code):

;; ((sentence-id . (entity-id start-index entity-size)))

;; using (visualize-entities-and-sentences ) one can transform this
;; output into ((entities found) sentence) for better visualization.

;; one can also count the entities found in the sentences provided,
;; using (count-entities (get-entids-from-entrecs entrecs), which will
;; give:

;; ((entity-id . entity-count))

;; again, for better visualization, one can use:

;; (viz-count raw-entities (count-entities (get-entids-from-entrecs
;; entrecs))))

;; where raw-entities is a list of the entities' names, in order of
;; id.

;;
;; to-do's:
;; encontrar submatches tb
;; transformar em função geradora
